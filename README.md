# Project Title

This simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) table backend web application is built with a RESTful API that allows users to perform CRUD operations on a list of items stored in a database. The API is built using a popular web framework such as Node.js, Express and PostgreSql.

Users can:

Retrieve a list of items.
Retrieve a single item.
Create a new item.
Update an existing item.
Delete an existing item.
To get started, you'll need to have Node.js and PostgreSql installed on your machine. Then, clone the repository and run npm install to install the required dependencies. After that, you can start the server by running npm start.

Please note that this is a simple backend, it has to be integrated with a frontend to display the data.


## Endpoints:
